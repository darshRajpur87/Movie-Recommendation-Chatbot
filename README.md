## ðŸ“– About the Project

The Movie Recommendation Chatbot helps users find movie suggestions tailored to their preferences. The system takes genre-based input from the user through a chatbot interface and uses a machine learning model (TF-IDF + Cosine Similarity) to return a list of recommended movies. This recommendation engine is trained on a dataset of movies containing titles and genres.
